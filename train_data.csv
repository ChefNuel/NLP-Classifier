"Currently dealing with them, left 13 months into a 24 month contract beside of how awful the situation was at the hospital. It was a sinking ship. I documented everything with the higher ups and despite all of that they sent me to collections 18 months after I quit lol",Medical Doctor
"Do you mind sharing how many years out you are, if you cut, and if you are boarded?",Medical Doctor
"I'm a physician, my spouse is a vet so I have seen both sides.¬†


In regards to money, wife has been doing much better financially than we ever expected. Her first year she started at 85k with RVU bonus, she has been practicing for 5 years now and this year made about 200k net. Money seems to be getting better but my income potential is still double and I am a generalist.¬†


Both fields can be very challenging and rewarding in their own ways. Big knock on being an MD is the residency- this is a huge time commitment. For me it was three years of minimal social life. Wife got to avoid this completely.¬†


I think if you want to work with animals- then go for it. Being an MD is also a great career it just takes so much damn time to get to the point where you are practicing.


Between the two of us the debt absolutely sucks. Please for the love of God have a plan on how you're going to deal with this. If you take out 200k for school that interest is 1k monthly!¬†|I'm a physician, my spouse is a vet so I have seen both sides.¬†

"My thoughts exactly - human physician here. Every time I go to my dog‚Äôs vet and look at the anatomical models on the walls it blows my mind. Not only do they have to treat every other species, they do medicine, dentistry and surgery on them ü§Ø‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been learning about some of the things they can do on animals now and it‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶ my specialty (EM) is generally considered a jack of all trades because we‚Äôre ready to see everyone for anything but I take my hat off to all our vet colleagues, you guys are truly rock stars. Man I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate you guys saving my pups bacon more than once.",Medical Doctor

"So.... back in like, the early Cretaceous when I was in school (not at Purdue) it was very similar. Everyone sleeping with each other were used to after three years of it- students, faculty, faculty spouses- you name a combination, it happened. The insane work load (we were expected to staff the wards overnight in addition to 8am classes AND 12-14 hr days in the clinic) we could deal with.   
The toxic behaviour not so much. My class sued a couple of our profs, I think, and got one thrown out of the classroom for sexual harassment, though he kept his job. So it has been done.   
These days, knowing what I know now, I would urge you and your classmates to go the state and federal regulatory route. Call OSHA. Call your state radiation permit/oversight agency. Hell, call the labor dept and ACLU over the pregnancy thing. Filing complaints with the site visit team is a little more fraught, but might carry more weight or yield more immediate results.   
Also totally a legit course to simply put your head down and grind if that is what you need to do to get out. It sounds like you're to the point where you feel you have to take action though. Whatever you choose to do, good luck, and thanks for caring and wanting to make the situation better in the future!|Thirty years in practice. Seen this way more than once. Surgeons are the worst, cuz they don't know even know human pharm.",Medical Doctor
"How coincidental you post this right after I get a call on my day off getting bitched at about something I didn't handle appropriately (not a medical decision, something logistical). 

You also didn't mention the constant flow of emails from bullshit wellness committees and people who get paid livable wages to send emails all-day about wellness. It's all fake. Like some snacks and a couch that I never have time to sit on is going to help. The money we generate pays their salaries to sit around and preach to us about wellness while not doing a damn shit thing to change the system that needs to be rearranged from the ground up. It's sickening. I hate this.

I recommended a vet patient start fluoxetine and she argued with me endlessly about the appropriate starting dose because ‚ÄúI prescribe this frequently.‚Äù ¬†I seriously had to shut her up to explain that dosing is completely different in humans. ¬†She rolled her eyes at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to do my own research on that.‚Äù ¬†A lot of humans are just assholes. ¬†,Medical Doctor
"This is actually really helpful. I was thinking the same recently after seeing some posts commenting on what current new grad salaries are... I had no idea the starting salaries had gotten so high. Everyone deserves to get paid fairly for our time and skills, but it is hard to know what's ""competitive"" when salaries appear to be changing rapidly from year to year and vary so much with COL. I definitely need to renegotiate with my clinic to reflect my experience and this info would be very helpful to have. Nice site",Medical Doctor
"We have had cameras in our exam rooms for years, and all our phone calls are recorded.  I used to feel intimidated by that, but you get used to it. 
If anything, there are more positives than negatives. Specially the phone recordings have been helpful when colleagues have had a board complaint. Recordings transcripts are provided for the case and usually complaints have been dismissed.",Medical Doctor

"My sister is a veterinarian and I am a physician.  Seriously, neither of us would have ANY idea how to do the other one‚Äôs job.

"So you don‚Äôt necessarily have to lock yourself in for 10 consecutive years.

Mine is not, but I'm trying to make my situation better by specializing (but being realistic I would need a great sacrifice like living abroad for 5 years or other).

It's not an easy profession mentally, socially and physically, so it is not worth it if you could consider any other career to be of equal interest to you.",Medical Doctor

"It's brilliant! It depends on the company that you go with or the practice that you go for I guess.. I won't name the company that I work for as I don't know if it would be a good idea for me. 

What I will say though, as this is my suspicion, the bigger the company the better the professional/career benefits(like CPD - Continuous Professional Development - with costs covered by the company), but the worse work life balance(but this depends on the area and people(which itself, people is a hugely varying factor))

I would say that the company I work for is fairly big. They provide great CPD sessions and I am lucky enough to have chosen an area where the teams that I work with are great and quite multi cultural and understanding, whilst the people/customers are minimally racist and sexist(although be prepared to see that every so often regardless.. people are dumb af) so I am very happy with my choice to have come to the UK on a Graduate Scheme a few years back. The company helped me develop a lot and I feel that I have become a great surgeon because of all their support

BUT.. I had colleagues in London that were going through hell while in the grad program because of the workload dumped on them.. also the cost of living was and still is huge compared to other areas of the country, whilst their salary was the same as mine.

Look into how legal it is to film customers in this way without them knowing. If there is a legal issue I would probably bring that up rather than my being uncomfortable being recorded.

From a professional perspective, I couldn't say it's something completely fair nor something completely wrong.. I'd say there are a couple of factors at play here. 

If your boss is a piece of shit, with a known track record of picking on everything, sanctioning every tiny detail and not allowing any mistakes(known or unknown to the customer), well then, this approach is just despicable, not because (s)he is recording, but because (s)he is basically saying ""I will see you, I will find your every mistake and hold you up to it""

On the other hand, if your boss is a great person, that looks to teach you, to mentor you, to be by your side and guide you into your career, then this is potentially a good approach. I'm saying that due to an experience I heard of a new doctor was being mentored/shadowed by the lead vet and because of that, the customer wasn't even considering the new grad. They had to resort to hiding behind a door so that they wouldn't interfere with the consults but still hear what was being said. That was to provide confidence to the new grad(so they wouldn't feel completely alone) as well as step in if something was completely wrong. 

I suspect that having recordings of consults can potentially help in cases like these, but again, it depends, so I hope these perspectives help.

"I‚Äôm a human doctor who has fostered many a dog, and this is eye opening to me. I had no idea it was illegal to administer vaccines to animals, and while I haven‚Äôt done it myself, I also can‚Äôt say I have ever actually looked into the topic. I have, however, been around others (also human doctors in the field of rescue work) who I absolutely witnessed giving injections to puppies/dogs that would come through the rescues we worked with. The vaccines from what I recall were provided by the rescue, but I may be mistaken. Otherwise I have no idea where/how the actual vaccine was obtained. On another note, I was often provided with human medications for dogs, and had to adjust dose based on weight. I assumed these meds all come from the same pharmacy and that there likely wasn‚Äôt actual differences in the meds based on human vs dog prescription. I do understand splitting pills doesn‚Äôt mean a standard dose will be obtained, but also thought nothing of it as I always had to split pills that were prescribed for the dogs specifically as well.

"I find that it is not unusual for seasoned techs to be a bit apprehensive about new docs.  This was how it was for me when I started ER 25 years ago.  I also learned to *listen* to my *seasoned* techs carefully.
9 times out of 10, they are correct.  

As a new doctor that never did any GP and went right into ER from day one, I can't tell you how invaluable those techs were to me.

Having said that, there are techs that think they know it all.  Those may or may not have years of experience under their belt.  
I was pretty good at figuring out those that *thought* they knew a lot from those that actually did know a lot.  The former? I would just give a bit of a nod too and then proceed to ignore their advice.  The latter?  I would seriously consider their input.

Personally, I ask all my techs and fellow docs to call me by first name.  Yeah...yeah... I know I *earned* the right to be called Doctor but it always feels hierarchical and I like my nurses to feel uninhibited about coming to me for anything.  Clients always call me doctor.

Having said that, if the protocol there is for the nurses to refer to doctors as ""doctor"" (or if that was your preference) and that one nurse was refusing to call you doctor, I would be having a discussion with the lead nurse about it; assuming I asked the offending nurse to call me doctor and it went nowhere.
That is blatant disrespect and I will NOT tolerate that towards me or anyone else|ER Doctor here.  Can confirm.

Having said that, if the protocol there is for the nurses to refer to doctors as ""doctor"" (or if that was your preference) and that one nurse was refusing to call you doctor, I would be having a discussion with the lead nurse about it; assuming I asked the offending nurse to call me doctor and it went nowhere.
That is blatant disrespect and I will NOT tolerate that towards me or anyone else|ER Doctor here.  Can confirm.

"I think a lot of other people made some good points so I‚Äôm not going to repeat a lot of it. It‚Äôs never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitive.

Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.|Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it‚Äôs not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that‚Äôs how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. 

For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it‚Äôs clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don‚Äôt know and doctors don‚Äôt know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.|I think a lot of other people made some good points so I‚Äôm not going to repeat a lot of it.

There are already many UK companies that offer these services, including Cloud 9 Vets who are nation-wide, and various mobile vets who cover smaller areas.

When OP asked about using ‚ÄúDr Name, DVM‚Äù, they implied they are graduating from a US based school, or one that confers a doctorate in veterinary medicine. US graduates need a doctorate in order to practice medicine - so I was speaking to the cultural standards in the US. 

I understand you may be in the US practicing with a foreign degree, or still practicing in your country with that degree - and in other countries, being a veterinarian may not require a doctorate degree. Those countries set their own standards to confer the doctor title. When you move to the US, you are required to undergo degree verification which reviews your coursework from your university to determine if you received doctorate level coursework, or if you have to complete additional training in the US in order to get that determination. 

There is no attack here on you or your ability to use the term doctor, but purely a cultural difference that was not clearly stated.|I could never get a Millers knot (modified or regular) regardless of how much I tried, so I always double ligated.

That said, I really like what people are saying about testing a different clinic. I am in a hot spot for vet med and I actually really like that - I can send things to ER when they are out of my wheelhouse, and when there's a surgery I haven't seen yet and don't feel comfortable doing, we have plenty of surgeons in our network who would be fine with it. I've heard stories from my friend who came from rural practice about the kinds of things he had to do (ER-adjacent) because they were the only clinic around for several hours.. 

I've also read that the first year out is the hardest thing you'll do. So if there's any chance you do want to stick with it, I'd find a clinic with better mentorship.|Hi! I‚Äôm in San Diego, 2023 grad at $140k, pro-sal 19% production. Personally I find it really hard to reach production, which is good/fine for now but I guess just to warn you.

Noncompetes aren‚Äôt enforceable in CA I‚Äôve been told. 
CE sounds appropriate, I‚Äôd ask for more PTO but also 120 isn‚Äôt bad for a first job, just concerning that that is also sick time.

Overall a solid offer, coming from someone in a similarly-high cost of living location. I would make sure you have good mentorship at your clinic and find out if you‚Äôre ever expected to be solo and how long before they put you in those situations.|In short, no, it‚Äôs not that bad

- Seek a second professional opinion

- Follow up with a boarded specialist if appropriate

- Follow the treatment regimen as prescribed instead of discontinuing early. 

What is NOT the answer is to do nothing and then complain that nothing improves. 
There are MANY conditions that do not improve with a single treatment and require ongoing care or changes in treatment along the way.Somenof them appear healed for a while and can flare up again. In fact, most of the conditions that are the MOST frustrating to owners are things that are chronically managed (for example, allergies and ear infections).

I *love* advanced medicine, and learning, and teaching, and research, and I would have made a damn good resident and internist. 

But I want to see my fucking family, and ride my horse, and sleep more than 4 hours a night, and pay off my $300k student loans.

And so I watch the increasingly desperate ads from vet schools for interns, residents, and clinicians and wonder what they'll do when there's no one left.|I was close friends with some residents and interns in my fourth year, and it physically pained me to see people call them bitchy and complain about them when I had watched those same residents and interns cry in front of me because they were so tired and overworked. Should they be lashing out? In theory, I'd love to say no. But it's pretty hard to be a sunny disposition and not get frustrated when you're running an entire hospital service with only students for help, your attending is MIA, and you haven't slept in 24 hours. 

The trickle down misery is so real|I don't have a lot of suggestions, but I just wanted to say that we as veterinarians really appreciate that someone who isn't involved AT ALL in vet med cares so much about this topic that they looked into it and are interested in helping. 

Perhaps reaching out to the AVMA (the national group that is in charge of oversight of the vet school programs and such) and expressing your concern as a pet owner that veterinarians are experiencing poor working conditions and you want to know what they're doing about it.

One of the problems is that there seems to be no oversight: the AVMA likes to put out pretty words and ""suggestions"" like restrictions on student hours spent in clinics, but there are no consequences for programs that don't follow these restrictions. What this results in is that young vets are ""talking with their actions"" and not doing internships and residencies...which is going to (and has already) lead to shortages in specialties or select for people who don't care about fairness and just keep the same attitude, rather than anything changing. Maybe if the big organizations realized the general public is aware of their dirty laundry and concerned about their transparency and the blind eye they're turning, they would do a little more.|Lmao this reminds me of our communication training. We had ""scenarios"" with paid actors, whom we had to placate and cater to and never ever be honest with despite ridiculous scenarios- one of them was a man with a cat who ate a vegetarian diet because he was vegan and the scenario was that his cat had heart failure and he refused to give it meat/taurine. 

I also was once told that ""I didn't show enough empathy,"" to a client whose fake cat had kidney failure. The way I approached it was to explain what kidney failure was, gave them the options, and then waited for them to process it and remained a calm sounding board and answer their questions. Wtf did they want, for me to cry with the fake client over their fake cat? 

Not once has anything from that stupid class ever helped me, and I always thought the way they coached you to speak sounded extremely condescending, like you were talking to a child.

Edit: FWIW, I have received rave reviews from my bosses about my communication with clients, even clients who have been prickly about seeing ""the new vet"" in the past. So whatever I'm doing is working|I can probably elaborate on what the previous poster is dancing around. What if your mentor isn't doing a good job, and you don't feel like you can go to them (or they're taking advantage of you- giving you cases that aren't good learning opportunities, being unavailable when you need help, etc.) but they're also your boss? How do you approach issues in your learning or place in a clinic when you are worried about your job security because the person you should be able to go to for advice is also the one screwing you over?|Where did you go?!?

I've only known one person who went to Davis but she really liked it, I've known a few who either went to or worked with students from NC state and NC state sounds like maybe it coddles them a bit and makes it hard to get the experience needed to be a competent doctor fresh out of school (ie limited opportunities to do things like equine GP work because they don't have that as a rotation, less chances to put in catheters because techs do it most of the time unless you're really self-motivated and insist on doing it).

Definitely don't just take my word for this as most of it is second hand, I went to neither. I think both are likely good schools|We autoligated almost all our cat spays (even pregnant...) when I was doing a shelter med rotation. It made me incredibly anxious at first and I did not enjoy it but I eventually warmed to it. I had several I insisted on throwing ligatures on because I felt the pedicle was fraying too much to be comfortable pulling it enough to autoligate. It is tricky to maneuver the mosquitoes to grab the pedicle in the right spot to ligate, but there were only one or two ovaries (out of like 7 cats) that I genuinely couldn't get it, and the more experienced surgeons did it just fine. I'm not positive but I think we autoligated male dogs as well?

I LOVED autoligating male cats, very efficient, similar to a horse castration (my chosen field).

I just hate surgeries in general and am very happy never spaying a cat or dog again!|The uterus we did with sutures, miller knots. But the ovary was autoligated similar to the testicle, clamping and twisting the pedicle around the mosquitos as close to the ovary as possible, then snipping off the horn/ovary, and doing the little autoligation push. I had a few where the pedicle sheared and tore while I was pushing the pedicle off the mosquitoes (I always noticed it before fully releasing, so no bleeding) and those ones I just kept my mosquitoes in place and slipped a millers knot down over my mosquitoes to tie deeper into the body cavity, and then ""finished"" the autoligation. It always felt more risky than the neuters, it didn't feel like a super secure grip on the pedicle to me. But it worked great in a shelter med setting with limited resources I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è|Huh that's interesting. Yeah it's definitely a bit awkward.

"Don't let one bad or toxic workplace ruin your vet med career for you. You did the whole education, you worked to this point.
You are describing a horrible workplace you should leave asap. I don't think talking to the owner/boss will change much. I've seen it lots of times: a lot of promises but they don't put it in writing so it's not valid.

Keep searching for a good clinic or practice. There are good managers, there are good clients, there are bosses who dare to say 'we don't have the time or utilities to help you, we'll refer you to X' , there are places where you can learn and grow.
Don't quit vet med before you try out other options.

And if you really don't like practice, check out the other options of your degree. A veterinarian can work for the private sector like pharmaceuticals, food etc, or for the government for food safety.

Don't give up, I believe in you|I like your Facebook page already, keep up the good work|I would not advise you to go to Belgium.

I can only speak from a small animal perspective, but all the big corporations (Anicura, Evidensia, Nesto, etc) promise you a lot but give you little and try to keep you bound to them.

In Belgium, >95% of vets are zelfstandige/freelancer, and are paid between 20-30eu/hour for starters. This rate would be nice if you are on payroll, but as a zelfstandige, it's really not a lot. For comparison, as a zelfstandige it is advised to have an accountant. My accountant charges 85‚Ç¨/h. So I need to work 2.5-3h to pay my accountant 1 hour (of course not counting any vat/taxes/etc for your pay).  
In the Netherlands, you can be a zelfstandige or ZZP'er, they are often paid a lot better (heard things of 70‚Ç¨/h). But mainly, most vets in the Netherlands are on a payroll, which I would advise you to do unless you want to start your own practice/clinic/service.

To clarify about the Corporations binding you: they pay shit and they will tell you right in your face that you are not worth more, even though you will make clients pay 5-10x more for your service than what you get from the corportation in hourly fee.  
But the main thing is that they try to bribe you (convince you the low pay is worth it) with continued education e.g. ESAVS. ESAVS is amazing, worth a lot, but hella expensive. So either you have to work for the corporations for x amount of years, or if you quit sooner, you have to repay them. And we are talking about education worth 4-5 numbers (‚Ç¨XX XXX)

Don't know any details about Germany.

For your last question: I've heard of them but most are either via a corporation or an internship. You're better of working for an experienced vet who wants to learn you things than keep on getting education from people that are no longer active in the field|Oh but that's a whole other story! Then the options are a lot better, and paid a lot better.

But no matter what sector you choose to work is, clinical or pharma or whatever, just remember this:

Working as a zelfstandige is only really interesting if you either earn a loooot of money (100‚Ç¨/h or more) or if you own your own company/service. Not like in the clinics in Belgium where you are paid hourly and low wage (schijnzelfstandigheid, mag eigenlijk niet maar bon).
In all other cases, get payroll en have the courage to ask for a raise if you are doing a good job",Veterinarian

"High speed scanners make quick work of this.

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients. Deal with paper charts for the ones that are enormous or are likely to pass soonish or may never come back. Pay someone else to scan the rest. You still have to have someone (you or a well-trained tech) to read the record and enter any necessary database info.|> I also see many people saying RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way.

It doesn't count at all towards a four year graduate degree in veterinary medicine.  But veterinary students usually complete a four year bachelor's degree prior to applying to veterinary school.  

If the RVT program is at an accredited institution such as a community college, some of their credits can be transferred to a four year university and may help them achieve their bachelor's in less than four full years.

RVT school is primarily a vocational program. Thus the ""T"" for technician. They don't diagnose or prescribe.

Don't get me wrong. RVTs are worth their weight in gold. But it's a completely different level of education and type of training than what a veterinarian receives.",Veterinarian
"Agreed, this is a very toxic environment. I'd find a new place to work. Experienced techs are supposed to be there to help and support new doctors, not tear them down. 

Over the course of my career as a tech, I've found that bad doctors are bad doctors, regardless of how long they've been practicing. I've worked with a lot of new grads who were better doctors than the 10-yr experienced vet. Being careful, and thorough, is expected from new grads, and your techs are supposed to be there to help things run efficiently and be a sounding board if you need it. So this sounds like a clinic culture issue, and leaving is really the only way for you to have a good outcome. I would be very forthcoming about the reason why you're leaving, so the PM can hopefully get things fixed for the next new grad, but trying to get those changes in place while you're working there typically backfires, because the techs will blame you and things will just get worse (been there, lived that, and left the practice for a better one.)",Veterinarian

"Average new grad salary in the US for small/ companion animal general practice is ~$120,000.

US veterinarians often have a ""ProSal"" compensation structure-- you are paid some percentage of the revenue you produce for your employer, but also have a guaranteed minimum. You can find articles about the details.

Like any other profession, compensation will vary based on geographic area. High cost of living areas (ie, New York City, San Francisco) will have higher compensation than low cost of living areas (such as rural communities).

Off-hours/ emergency coverage can also impact compensation.|Short answer: No.

Long answer:

In a just world, I'd say you should administer first aid if you find someone in legitimate need of immediate lifesaving action. But first, look up your state's good Samaritan laws. If you save someone's life by performing CPR, can they sue you later for breaking their ribs in the process? It's happened!

Also, if you do choose to involve yourself, step out of the way immediately when the professionals arrive (Police/ ambulance).

Also note that, state dependent, licensed veterinarians are sometimes authorized to practice human medicine in truly cataclysmic disasters (ie, nuclear war)|Not sure if you're in the US or elsewhere in the world. The OP of this post is asking in a US context. In the US, ""doctor"" is a title earned through education, not licensing. If a veterinarian (or physician) is only licensed to practice in the state of New York, their title is still ""Doctor"" when they go on vacation to California.

Plenty of people have the title of ""doctor"" completely independent of any government-issued license-- for example, college/ university professors.

Thoroughly understood that there are places in the world that do not require a doctoral degree to practice veterinary medicine, and I do not know what the title conventions are in those place.|Generally not a major risk.

If the client is visibly high in your interactions and seems to be going through the meds faster than you'd anticipate, then you're setting yourself up for some possibility of legal trouble.

If you're prescribing them an inappropriately high volume of meds that the client is then selling on the street, you know how that's going to end.

Three sorts of legal issues, broadly speaking:

* Regulatory: If you're abusing your state and federal licensing, those license may be revoked.
* Criminal: If you're a drug dealer, expect to be prosecuted like any other drug dealer.
* Civil: If someone is hurt as a direct or indirect consequence of substance abuse that you facilitated or enabled, you are at risk of being sued.

In the non-flagrant scenarios, a civil suit is the most likely risk. Someone dies from overdosing on something you prescribed? Grieving family members may try to deflect some responsibility onto you. Someone is hurt in a car crash when your client drives under the influence of something you prescribed to their pet? The accident attorneys take a shotgun approach of suing anyone even tangentially involved-- and you, as someone in a relatively high income profession, are a juicy target.",Veterinarian
"Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way!

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way! 

Good luck! (:|Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist.

I did some searches on the pair value that is in the quickswap error and I saw successful transactions, but they were like 17 days ago. so dont know if quickswap is having a problem in recognizing it, but it looks like it will work with the above steps.

"I'm at Penn, I think it's a mixed bag. 

Cons: the curriculum I'm on is being phased out and a new one is coming in, so it's very much in a transitory state. Seems like the new curriculum is good and is getting people more hands on experience? Hands on experience rn is in the cons column for me, it mostly falls on me to pursue opportunities outside of class. Also my big complaint is disorganization and communication. It often feels like no one is ""driving the car"" and there are just too many siloed services that don't talk to each other or to us lol. Also I do not like Philly that much (expensive and I'm not a city guy) and the split campus thing sucks if you're large animal focused (large animal hospital is an hour outside the city). Oh also we lost our exotics service during the pandemic.

Pros: High quality of professors (sometimes a bad thing bc a person teaching you is too educated to see where common blind spots might be), a lot of them are very good at teaching. Good case load for certain things (shelter med and small animal stuff in general, small animal specialty, standardbred race horses, high level show horses, dairy and pork to some extent). Scholarship availability seems to be halfway decent here too, maybe better than at a public institution? Also I think the abuse students receive here is less than at other schools? Idk reading some other threads here I suddenly feel like I have it good, very few people have given me a shitty attitude. And the gossip suggests that the really egregious cases actually get addressed. I also feel like the education has made me super prepared for the NAVLE but I'm also a tryhard who studies too much. 

Idk that I would recommend it (maybe if you really like the city and you're small animal focused with an eye for residency) and if I got a do-over idk that I would go here again for sure (I had a comparable offer elsewhere), but I feel very confident that it could be worse, I don't super hate it here, and I'm getting a pretty solid education at least in the theoretical parts.|I'm at Penn, I think it's a mixed bag. 

Cons: the curriculum I'm on is being phased out and a new one is coming in, so it's very much in a transitory state. Seems like the new curriculum is good and is getting people more hands on experience? Hands on experience rn is in the cons column for me, it mostly falls on me to pursue opportunities outside of class. Also my big complaint is disorganization and communication. It often feels like no one is ""driving the car"" and there are just too many siloed services that don't talk to each other or to us lol. Also I do not like Philly that much (expensive and I'm not a city guy) and the split campus thing sucks if you're large animal focused (large animal hospital is an hour outside the city). Oh also we lost our exotics service during the pandemic.

Pros: High quality of professors (sometimes a bad thing bc a person teaching you is too educated to see where common blind spots might be), a lot of them are very good at teaching. Good case load for certain things (shelter med and small animal stuff in general, small animal specialty, standardbred race horses, high level show horses, dairy and pork to some extent). Scholarship availability seems to be halfway decent here too, maybe better than at a public institution? Also I think the abuse students receive here is less than at other schools?

"Currently in vet school. Hard as hell but well worth it. It is a very good market for graduating vets with GPs making great salaries.|I think it‚Äôs a very interesting opportunity. I‚Äôm pro-owning for sure. Valuation is very difficult because you probably don‚Äôt know how much the practice profits and the owner takes in yearly. Typically practice valuations go as a multiplier of the previous 12 months profit. 4-6x is pretty standard. Any higher than that is difficult to justify without significant opportunity to grow or add services. It‚Äôs one of the reasons corporations have been able to buy so many practices. They can afford to overpay, 8-10x profit for example, because they have deep pockets and they‚Äôll make back the money by cutting costs or decreasing salaries. So it‚Äôs tough to say in this situation without knowing typical profit. I‚Äôd say anywhere between 8-20% profit is typically where most practices sit but there are outliers on both sides. So if you gross 5-6 M and profit 20%, then the valuation isn‚Äôt as crazy. If you profit 8% then it‚Äôs absolutely wild. 

As for partners I think it‚Äôs very situational. You can also organize it in different ways. Maybe you take a lead, pay more and have a larger portion and therefore more decision power. I also don‚Äôt see a huge problem with 4-5 equal partners with equal say as long as there is a good contract with out-clauses for each partner. Owning a practice can be an opportunity to set yourself, and your family if you have one, up for life financially.

I‚Äôm also a junior bio student but most advice I hear is to diversify your application as much as possible, which is what you‚Äôre doing with large animal.

"Fellow european here. I would guess it greatly depends also on what country you're studying in. I'm doing a bit of research myself, and in places like Italy the cost of tuition and bills would still be very low compared to US. I glanced at some vet med curricula and it looks like except for practical courses you don't have to attend the classes to take the exams. Additionally I know a lot of universities in Italy offer the possibility of pursuing a degree as a part-time student; it takes longer than the usual time-span, but it gives you time to still have a job and sustain yourself financially.
Sorry for the wall of text, I hope it is useful, I don't know where you're from in Europe, but Italy might be a decent choice if you're looking for relatively cheap places to study.|Fellow european here.

"Anyone who's made it to 4th year can be a veterinarian.  You've got everything it takes, with years of credits backing that statement up.  It may be as simple as just getting through this current rotation and planning on never seeing these people again, since they don't sound particularly kind and the environment hardly sounds conducive to learning. 

I also struggle a lot with getting out of my own head, especially when it comes to certain tasks like catheterizations and blood draws.  I've gotten quite down on myself, feeling like a failure of a student and future veterinarian.  It seems like I fuck up the simplest of tasks.  When I'm deep in some trench like that in my head, I try to hold onto a particular memory of myself using needle drivers for the first time.  I was so awkward and bad at picking the needle up and holding it correctly, let alone passing it through tissue.  Something as simple as tying a square knot seemed lightyears away. I still struggle with suturing (still in vet school), but I can at least grab the needle pretty easily now!  I can even tie a decent square knot most of the time.   

There are things you do mindlessly today that once took real effort and concentration, I'm sure.  It all works like that, even if it seems like it doesn't.  It's a shame that we can only ever focus on what we are doing wrong, rather than what we do so right it has become automatic.  Keep your chin up and try to find a memory of your own to hold onto.  You're going to make it through this, and you're going to be a damn fine veterinarian.  The folks who weren't going to make it left the program sometime in the first few years.",Other
